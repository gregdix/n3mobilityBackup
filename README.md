# Limitations

* In the device simulator, you need to set the persistent and temporary file storage set for the `LocalFileSystem` object. You can choose folders from your local file system and set them for the `LocalFileSystem` constants. For more information, see [Simulate File Storage][Simulate File Storage].
* The device simulator returns the following constants: `%simulator_persistent_root%` and `%simulator_temporary_root%` for the persistent and the temporary root paths, respectively.
* File paths are case sensitive in iOS and case insensitive in Android.
